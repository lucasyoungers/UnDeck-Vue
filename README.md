# UnDeck

Hi, I'm Lucas, and this is my passion project. I've spent a large part of my life playing the Pokémon Trading Card Game, and even longer coming up with decks. Back in the day, I would use a word document or a notebook, but with UnDeck, you can make any deck a reality.

UnDeck is primarily a deck builder and proxy printer.

##### Deck Builder
UnDeck supports the top-of-the-line options for optimal deck building, with little interference from the few snappy animations the app does have. It also supports advanced card search, which will be expanded upon in future updates.

##### Proxy Printer
Have you ever been in that situation where you're waiting on a card in the mail, but you're just itching to try out your brand-new deck? Well fear not, UnDeck has got you covered. No longer need you place images crudely into a word document, and try to size them so you can print a card or two. UnDeck does that all for you, perfectly sized to the pixel.

Let's hear what some of our satisfied customers* have to say.

(*UnDeck is a free and open source service.)
